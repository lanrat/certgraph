# CertGraph

## A tool to crawl the graph of certificate Alternate Names

CertGraph crawls SSL certificates creating a directed graph where each domain is a node and the certificate alternative names for that domain's certificate are the edges to other domain nodes. New domains are printed as they are found. In Detailed mode upon completion the Graph's adjacency list is printed.

Crawling defaults to collecting certificate by connecting over TCP, however there are multiple drivers that can search [Certificate Transparency](https://www.certificate-transparency.org/) logs.

This tool was designed to be used for host name enumeration via SSL certificates, but it can also show you a "chain" of trust between domains and the certificates that re-used between them.

## Drivers

CertGraph has multiple options for querying SSL certificates. The driver is responsible for retrieving the certificates for a given domain. Currently there are the following drivers:

* **http** this is the default driver which works by connecting to the hosts over HTTPS and retrieving the certificates from the SSL connection

* **smtp** like the *http* driver, but connects over port 25 and issues the *starttls* command to retrieve the certificates from the SSL connection

* **censys** this driver searches Certificate Transparency logs via [censys.io](https://search.censys.io/certificates). No packets are sent to any of the domains when using this driver. Requires Censys API keys

* **crtsh** this driver searches Certificate Transparency logs via [crt.sh](https://crt.sh/). No packets are sent to any of the domains when using this driver


## Example

```console
$ ./certgraph -details eff.org
eff.org 0       Good    42E3E4605D8BB4608EB64936E2176A98B97EBF2E0F8F93A64A6640713C7D4325
maps.eff.org    1       Good    42E3E4605D8BB4608EB64936E2176A98B97EBF2E0F8F93A64A6640713C7D4325
https-everywhere-atlas.eff.org  1       Good    42E3E4605D8BB4608EB64936E2176A98B97EBF2E0F8F93A64A6640713C7D4325
httpse-atlas.eff.org    1       Good    42E3E4605D8BB4608EB64936E2176A98B97EBF2E0F8F93A64A6640713C7D4325
atlas.eff.org   1       Good    42E3E4605D8BB4608EB64936E2176A98B97EBF2E0F8F93A64A6640713C7D4325
kittens.eff.org 1       Good    42E3E4605D8BB4608EB64936E2176A98B97EBF2E0F8F93A64A6640713C7D4325
```

The above output represents the adjacency list for the graph for the root domain `eff.org`. The adjacency list is in the form:
`Node    Depth    Status    Cert-Fingerprint`

## Compiling

To compile certgraph you must have a working Go 1.23 or newer compiler on your system.
To compile for the running system compilation is as easy as running make

```console
certgraph$ make
go build -o certgraph certgraph.go
```

```console
go install github.com/lanrat/certgraph@latest
```

```console
# Build the binary
make

# Run tests
make test

# Run linting
make lint

# Build Docker image locally
make docker
```

## [Web UI](https://lanrat.github.io/certgraph/)

A web UI is provided in the docs folder and is accessible at the github pages url [https://lanrat.github.io/certgraph/](https://lanrat.github.io/certgraph/), or can be run from the embedded web server by calling `certgraph --serve 127.0.0.1:8080`.

The web UI takes the output provided with the `-json` flag.
The JSON graph can be sent to the web interface as an uploaded file, remote URL, or as the query string using the data variable.

## BygoneSSL detection

### Self Detection

CertGraph can be used to detect [BygoneSSL](https://insecure.design) DoS with the following options. CT-DRIVER can be any Certificate Transparency capable driver.
Provide all known input domains you own. If any domains you do not own are printed, then you are vulnerable.

```console
certgraph -depth 1 -driver CT-DRIVER -ct-subdomains -cdn -apex [DOMAIN]...
```

### Bug Bounty

If you want to find a vulnerable site that has a bug bounty, certgraph can be used with the following options and any driver. But you will have better luck with a non Certificate Transparency driver to ensure that the certificates in question are actually in use

```console
certgraph -cdn -dns -apex [DOMAIN]...
```

And domains that print `* Missing DNS for` have vulnerable certificates that should be rotated.
